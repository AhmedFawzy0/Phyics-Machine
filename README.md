# Physics-Machine

This is a physics engine simulator!

Currently it supports 1D collision simulations (elastic and inelastic), 
simply enter velocity and mass values and it will calculate rebound velocities and energy lost in the collision.

It is currently hosted here: [simulator](https://ahmedfawzy0.github.io/Physics-Machine/)

Below is the collision interface:
